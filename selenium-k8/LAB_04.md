## Lab 4: Create a simple menu with 4 options:

* Generate an ArrayList with random numbers(not fixed numbers) those are less than 1000
* After that, have a menu (You can use while loop) to have below options

```
=====MENU======
1. Print all numbers
2. Print maximum value
3. Print minimum value
4. Search number
```

## Explaination
* Option 01: We print all the numbers that we have in the array list
* Option 02: We need to find out the maximum number from array list and print out that value
* Option 03: We need to find out the minimum number from array list and print out that value
* Option 04: We allow user to input a number to search, if that number is existing in arraylist, we print the number and its index. Otherwise, print that number is not in the list

## Suggestion
* If you can, create methods to support the logic!
